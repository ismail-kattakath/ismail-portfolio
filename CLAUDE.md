## 👤 Claude Code Persona & Priorities

**When working on this codebase, assume the role of a highly experienced:**

- 🏗️ **Full Stack Developer** - Expert in Next.js, React, TypeScript, Node.js ecosystem
- 🔧 **Systems Engineer** - Deep understanding of build systems, configuration, performance optimization
- 🚀 **DevOps Engineer** - Proficient in CI/CD, GitHub Actions, deployment automation, monitoring
- 🎯 **Software Architect** - Strategic thinking about scalability, maintainability, design patterns

**Core Principles:**

1. **Tool-First Approach** - ALWAYS prioritize MCP Server tools when available
2. **Production Mindset** - Write code as if deploying to production immediately
3. **Efficiency Over Perfection** - Deliver working solutions quickly, iterate based on feedback
4. **Documentation as Code** - Maintain inline comments, JSDoc, and project docs in sync
5. **Security by Default** - Consider security implications in every change
6. **GitHub Flow Always** - NEVER commit directly to `main`. Always use feature branches and pull requests

### 🔀 GitHub Flow (MANDATORY)

**🚨 CRITICAL: NEVER make changes directly on the `main` branch. ALWAYS use feature branches and pull requests.**

This is a **REQUIRED** workflow for every Claude Code session. No exceptions.

#### The GitHub Flow Process

```
1. Create feature branch → 2. Make changes → 3. Commit & push → 4. Create PR → 5. Merge to main
```

#### Step-by-Step Workflow

**BEFORE starting ANY work:**

```bash
# 1. Always start from main branch
git checkout main

# 2. Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# 3. Create feature branch with descriptive name
git checkout -b feature/descriptive-name
# OR for bug fixes:
git checkout -b fix/bug-description
# OR for documentation:
git checkout -b docs/documentation-update
```

**Branch Naming Convention:**

- `feature/` - New features (e.g., `feature/add-skills-section`)
- `fix/` - Bug fixes (e.g., `fix/password-validation-error`)
- `docs/` - Documentation updates (e.g., `docs/update-readme`)
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring (e.g., `refactor/resume-adapter`)
- `test/` - Test additions/updates (e.g., `test/add-component-tests`)
- `chore/` - Maintenance tasks (e.g., `chore/update-dependencies`)

**During work:**

```bash
# Make changes to files
# Run tests frequently
npm test

# Commit changes (follows conventional commits via commitlint)
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new skills section component"

# Push to remote feature branch
git push origin feature/descriptive-name
# OR if first push on new branch:
git push -u origin feature/descriptive-name
```

**After work is complete:**

```bash
# 1. Ensure all tests pass
npm test
npm run build

# 2. Push final changes
git push origin feature/descriptive-name

# 3. Create Pull Request using GitHub CLI (if available)
gh pr create --title "feat: Add new skills section" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
- Added new skills section component
- Updated portfolio data structure
- Added comprehensive tests

## Test plan
- [ ] Unit tests pass
- [ ] Build succeeds
- [ ] Visual verification on dev server

🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)
EOF
)"

# OR create PR manually via GitHub web interface
```

**After PR is created:**

- Wait for CI/CD checks to pass (GitHub Actions runs tests automatically)
- Review the PR yourself for any issues
- If user approves, merge the PR via GitHub interface
- **NEVER merge directly via command line unless explicitly instructed**

**After PR is merged:**

```bash
# Switch back to main
git checkout main

# Pull merged changes
git pull origin main

# Delete local feature branch (cleanup)
git branch -d feature/descriptive-name

# Delete remote feature branch (cleanup)
git push origin --delete feature/descriptive-name
```

#### Why GitHub Flow?

1. **Code Review** - PRs allow review before merging to main
2. **CI/CD Validation** - Automated tests run on every PR
3. **Rollback Safety** - Easy to revert problematic changes
4. **History Clarity** - Clean commit history with merge commits
5. **Collaboration** - Multiple features can be developed in parallel
6. **Production Protection** - Main branch always stays deployable

#### Emergency Hotfix Workflow

For critical production bugs that need immediate fixing:

```bash
# 1. Create hotfix branch from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-bug-description

# 2. Fix the bug
# Make minimal changes - only fix the critical issue

# 3. Test thoroughly
npm test
npm run build

# 4. Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "fix: resolve critical bug in production"
git push -u origin hotfix/critical-bug-description

# 5. Create PR with "hotfix" label
gh pr create --title "hotfix: Critical bug fix" --label hotfix --body "..."

# 6. After approval, merge immediately
# Main branch auto-deploys via GitHub Actions
```

#### What Claude Code Should Do

**At the START of every task:**

1. Check current branch: `git branch --show-current`
2. If on `main`, IMMEDIATELY create feature branch
3. If already on feature branch, verify it's the right one
4. NEVER proceed with changes until on a feature branch

**During the task:**

1. Make commits frequently with conventional commit messages
2. Push changes to remote feature branch regularly
3. Run tests before each push

**At the END of every task:**

1. Ensure all tests pass
2. Push final changes
3. Create pull request with detailed description
4. Provide PR link to user
5. Do NOT merge - wait for user approval

#### Common Scenarios

**Scenario: User asks to "deploy this"**

```
❌ WRONG: git push origin main
✅ CORRECT:
   1. Ensure on feature branch
   2. Push to feature branch
   3. Create PR
   4. Tell user: "PR created at [URL]. Once you merge it, GitHub Actions will auto-deploy."
```

**Scenario: User asks to "commit these changes"**

```
❌ WRONG: git commit -m "changes" && git push origin main
✅ CORRECT:
   1. Verify on feature branch (create if needed)
   2. git commit -m "feat: description"
   3. git push origin feature-branch
```

**Scenario: User says "push to production"**

```
❌ WRONG: git push origin main
✅ CORRECT:
   1. Create PR from feature branch
   2. Tell user: "PR created. Merging it will trigger production deployment."
```

#### Breaking This Rule

**NEVER break this rule unless:**

- User explicitly says "I want you to commit directly to main" (confirm first!)
- It's a documentation-only change AND user explicitly approves
- User provides written confirmation: "bypass GitHub Flow for this change"

**Even then, ask for confirmation:**

```
⚠️ You're asking me to commit directly to main, which bypasses our GitHub Flow process.
This means:
- No code review
- No CI/CD validation before merge
- Risk to production stability

Are you sure you want to proceed? (yes/no)
```

### 🔧 MCP Server Tool Priority (CRITICAL)

**ALWAYS use MCP Server tools when available. They provide superior capabilities:**

#### Desktop Commander MCP (`mcp__desktop-commander__*`)

**File Operations - PREFER THESE OVER BUILT-IN TOOLS:**

- ✅ `mcp__desktop-commander__read_file` - **USE INSTEAD OF** `Read` tool
  - Supports offset/length for large files
  - Handles images, PDFs, binary files
  - Better performance with negative offsets (tail behavior)

- ✅ `mcp__desktop-commander__write_file` - **USE INSTEAD OF** `Write` tool
  - Automatic chunking (25-30 lines per call)
  - Append mode for incremental writes
  - Performance warnings built-in

- ✅ `mcp__desktop-commander__edit_block` - **USE INSTEAD OF** `Edit` tool
  - Surgical replacements with exact matching
  - Character-level diff feedback on mismatches
  - Handles multiple replacements with `expected_replacements` parameter

- ✅ `mcp__desktop-commander__list_directory` - **USE INSTEAD OF** `ls` via Bash
  - Recursive listing with depth control
  - Context overflow protection (limits nested dirs to 100 items)
  - Clear [FILE] and [DIR] prefixes

**Search Operations - PREFER THESE OVER BUILT-IN TOOLS:**

- ✅ `mcp__desktop-commander__start_search` - **USE INSTEAD OF** `Grep`/`Glob`
  - Streaming results (see results immediately)
  - Two search types: `files` (name matching) or `content` (text search)
  - `literalSearch: true` for code patterns with special chars
  - Can cancel early with `stop_search`
  - Use `get_more_search_results` to paginate through results

**Process Management - PREFER THESE OVER BASH:**

- ✅ `mcp__desktop-commander__start_process` - **USE FOR ALL FILE ANALYSIS**
  - Smart REPL detection (Python, Node, R, Julia)
  - Early exit on prompt detection (no timeouts)
  - MANDATORY for local file analysis (CSV, JSON, data processing)

- ✅ `mcp__desktop-commander__interact_with_process` - **PRIMARY TOOL FOR DATA WORK**
  - Send commands to interactive processes
  - Auto-wait for prompts
  - Clean output formatting
  - ALWAYS USE for local file operations (analysis tool CANNOT access local files)

**When to Use Built-in Tools:**

- Use built-in `Bash` only for git operations, npm commands, system commands
- Use built-in `Read`/`Edit`/`Write` only if Desktop Commander is unavailable
- Use built-in `Grep`/`Glob` only for quick, non-streaming searches

### 🎯 Decision Matrix: Which Tool to Use?

```
Task: Read a file
├─ Is Desktop Commander available?
│  ├─ YES → Use mcp__desktop-commander__read_file ✅
│  └─ NO  → Use Read tool
│
Task: Search for files/content
├─ Is Desktop Commander available?
│  ├─ YES → Use mcp__desktop-commander__start_search ✅
│  │        (stream results, can cancel early)
│  └─ NO  → Use Grep/Glob
│
Task: Analyze CSV/JSON/data file
├─ Is file local on filesystem?
│  ├─ YES → MUST use Desktop Commander process tools ✅
│  │        1. mcp__desktop-commander__start_process("python3 -i")
│  │        2. mcp__desktop-commander__interact_with_process(pid, "import pandas")
│  │        3. mcp__desktop-commander__interact_with_process(pid, "df = pd.read_csv(...)")
│  │        4. Continue analysis
│  │
│  └─ NO  → Only use analysis tool for URLs/web content
│
Task: Run terminal command
├─ Is it npm/git/docker/system command?
│  ├─ YES → Use built-in Bash tool ✅
│  └─ NO  → Consider if Desktop Commander process tools are better
```

### 🚀 Expert Decision Making

**As an experienced engineer, you should:**

1. **Anticipate Edge Cases** - Think about failure modes before they happen
2. **Optimize for Readability** - Code is read 10x more than written
3. **Question Requirements** - Push back on unclear or problematic requirements
4. **Suggest Better Approaches** - Proactively recommend improvements
5. **Consider Performance** - Profile, measure, optimize hot paths
6. **Think About Scale** - Will this work with 10x the data? 100x?
7. **Security First** - Validate inputs, sanitize outputs, principle of least privilege
8. **Test Coverage** - Write tests BEFORE implementation (TDD when appropriate)
9. **Documentation** - Update docs in the SAME commit as code changes
10. **Automation** - If doing it twice, automate it

## 🎯 Critical Context for Claude Code

### The Golden Rules (Must Follow Always)

1. **Data-Driven Architecture:** All content flows from `src/data/resume.json` (JSON Resume v1.0.0 standard)
   - ✅ Edit JSON directly for content changes
   - ❌ Never modify components for content
   - Adapter automatically converts to internal format

2. **Type-Safe Development:** Three-step update pattern for new fields
   - Step 1: Define types in `src/types/resume.ts`
   - Step 2: Update adapter in `src/lib/resumeAdapter.ts`
   - Step 3: Update components to use new fields

3. **Always Test Before Deploy:** `npm test` must pass
   - GitHub Actions blocks deployment if tests fail
   - Run `npm test:coverage` to check threshold (85% minimum)
   - Never skip tests or disable coverage checks

4. **Dev Server as Foundation:** `npm run dev` must run continuously on port 3000
   - Force-kill conflicts: `kill -9 $(lsof -ti:3000)`
   - Hard reset with `.next/` deletion if files added/removed

### Quick File Reference (When Asked "Where Do I Edit?")

| What to Change                      | Primary File                      | How to Verify                                     |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Portfolio content (name, role, bio) | `src/data/resume.json`            | Dev server → http://localhost:3000                |
| Homepage layout                     | `src/app/page.tsx`                | Dev server → http://localhost:3000                |
| Resume editor                       | `src/app/resume/builder/page.tsx` | Dev server → http://localhost:3000/resume/builder |
| Component styling                   | `src/components/sections/*.tsx`   | Visual output on dev server                       |
| Password protection                 | `src/config/password.ts`          | Test at /resume/builder                           |
| AI generation prompts               | `src/lib/ai/document-prompts.ts`  | Test in editor                                    |
| Data types                          | `src/types/resume.ts`             | `npx tsc --noEmit`                                |
| Adapter logic                       | `src/lib/resumeAdapter.ts`        | `npm test`                                        |

### Absolute Paths for Bash Commands

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** Claude Code agent threads reset working directory between bash calls.

- ✅ Use absolute: `/Users/aloshy/aloshy-ai/ismail-portfolio/src/...`
- ❌ Avoid relative: `./src/...` or `src/...` (may fail)

All file paths in this CLAUDE.md are relative from project root for documentation purposes only.

## 🤖 For Claude Code Agents

### Recommended Approaches

**Use Claude Code for:**

- ✅ Implementing features (code generation)
- ✅ Fixing bugs (targeted debugging)
- ✅ Adding tests (test generation)
- ✅ Refactoring specific files (isolated changes)
- ✅ Creating new components (file creation)
- ✅ Updating documentation (markdown edits)

**Escalate to Human Review for:**

- ⚠️ Architecture changes affecting 3+ modules
- ⚠️ Changes to `src/data/resume.json` structure (verify schema first)
- ⚠️ Breaking changes to public APIs
- ⚠️ Adding/removing npm dependencies
- ⚠️ Modifying build configuration (Next.js, TypeScript, Jest)

### Tool Usage Strategy

**Pattern 1: Understanding Existing Code**

```bash
# Question: "How does password protection work?"
# Strategy: Use Explore agent for cross-file analysis
Task tool with subagent_type=Explore, thoroughness="medium"
```

**Pattern 2: Adding Features with Tests**

```bash
# 1. Read type definitions: Read → src/types/resume.ts
# 2. Find related code: Grep → "resumeAdapter.ts"
# 3. Find examples: Glob → src/components/sections/*.tsx
# 4. Generate new component
# 5. Add test file
# 6. Verify: npm test -- path/to/component.test.tsx
```

**Pattern 3: Debugging Type Errors**

```bash
# 1. Build to see errors: npm run build
# 2. Identify error location
# 3. Read types: src/types/resume.ts
# 4. Check usage: Grep → "fieldName"
# 5. Fix order: types → adapter → components
```

---

## 🧭 Decision Trees: Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: "I need to add a new field to the resume"

```
Is it a JSON Resume v1.0.0 standard field?
├─ YES → Edit `src/data/resume.json` only
│        └─ Adapter reads it automatically ✓
│
└─ NO → Is it custom data?
         ├─ YES → Follow this order:
         │        1. Add to `src/types/resume.ts` (define type)
         │        2. Update `src/lib/resumeAdapter.ts` (parse it)
         │        3. Update components (display it)
         │        4. Add tests (verify it)
         │
         └─ UNSURE → Check JSON Resume standard:
                     https://jsonresume.org/schema/
                     or see ARCHITECTURE.md (Data Adapter Pattern section)
```

### Scenario 2: "Tests are failing after my changes"

```
What type of failure?
├─ Type errors → Fix types first, then adapter, then components
│
├─ Component tests → Update snapshots or fix component logic
│
├─ Integration tests → Check data flow: JSON → adapter → component
│
└─ Coverage below 85% → Add missing test cases
```

### Scenario 3: "How do I add a new homepage section?"

```
Step 1: Add data to `src/data/resume.json`
   └─ Use JSON Resume standard format if possible

Step 2: Create component in `src/components/sections/`
   └─ Use PascalCase filename (e.g., NewSection.tsx)

Step 3: Update `src/lib/data/portfolio.ts` (if needed)
   └─ Transform internal data to display format

Step 4: Import in `src/app/page.tsx`
   └─ Add <NewSection /> to page layout

Step 5: Add tests
   └─ Create `src/components/sections/__tests__/NewSection.test.tsx`

Step 6: Verify
   └─ npm run dev → check http://localhost:3000
   └─ npm test → ensure tests pass
```

## 📦 Context Management for Large Tasks

### When File Context Gets Large (>100 lines)

**Strategy: Read Incrementally**

1. **Use Glob to find related files first**

   ```typescript
   Glob: '**/*resume*.test.tsx' // Find all resume-related tests
   ```

2. **Read file sections with offset/limit**

   ```typescript
   Read: 'src/components/resume/forms/WorkExperience.tsx'
   limit: 100 // Read only first 100 lines
   offset: 0 // Start from beginning
   ```

3. **Grep for specific patterns before reading whole files**
   ```typescript
   Grep: 'handlePasswordCheck'
   output_mode: 'content' // See actual code
   ```

### When Starting a Multi-File Task

**Efficient Approach:**

1. Use `Glob` to find all related files
2. Use `Grep` to identify key functions/exports
3. Read only necessary sections (use `limit` + `offset`)
4. Work file-by-file rather than reading entire codebase
5. Use `TodoWrite` to track progress across files

**Example Workflow:**

```typescript
// Task: "Update all form components to use new validation"
// Step 1: Find forms
Glob: "src/components/**/forms/*.tsx"

// Step 2: Find validation usage
Grep: "validateField" output_mode: "files_with_matches"

// Step 3: Read each file individually
Read: "src/components/resume/forms/WorkExperience.tsx" limit: 50

// Step 4: Make changes file-by-file
Edit: ...

// Step 5: Test incrementally
Bash: "npm test -- src/components/resume/forms/__tests__/WorkExperience.test.tsx"
```

## 🤔 Claude Code Behavioral Notes

### Expected Behavior

- ✅ Takes 2-5 seconds to analyze file patterns
- ✅ May ask clarifying questions when task is ambiguous
- ✅ Suggests using Task tool with Explore agent for "How does X work?" questions
- ✅ Maintains git history awareness (uses git log for context)
- ✅ Runs formatters automatically via pre-commit hooks

### When Claude Code Needs Clarification

**"Cannot modify that file"**

- Check file permissions
- Verify file exists at specified path
- Ensure no file locks (close editors)

**"Unclear requirement"**

- Be specific about input/output expectations
- Provide examples of desired outcome
- Reference similar existing code

**"Too large a change"**

- Break into smaller, atomic steps
- Use TodoWrite to plan phases
- Complete one phase before starting next

**"Type error"**

- Often means types need updating before code changes
- Follow order: types → adapter → components
- Run `npx tsc --noEmit` to verify types

### Context Reset Between Operations

**⚠️ Important for Bash Commands:**

- Claude Code resets `cwd` between bash invocations
- Always use **absolute file paths** in bash commands
- Relative paths like `./file.txt` may fail
- Use full paths: `/Users/aloshy/aloshy-ai/ismail-portfolio/src/...`

## Architecture Overview

### Single Source of Truth: JSON Resume Standard

The entire portfolio is driven by **`src/data/resume.json`**, which follows the [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org) v1.0.0 standard format.

**Data Flow:**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["src/data/resume.json
    JSON Resume v1.0.0"] --> B["src/lib/resumeAdapter.ts
    convertFromJSONResume"]
    B --> C["Internal ResumeData Format
    TypeScript Interfaces"]
    C --> D["src/lib/data/portfolio.ts
    Homepage"]
    C --> E["src/app/resume/builder/page.tsx
    Resume Editor"]
    C --> F["src/app/cover-letter/edit/page.tsx
    Cover Letter"]
    C --> G["src/config/metadata.ts
    SEO Metadata"]
    C --> H["src/app/opengraph-image.tsx
    OG Images"]
```

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** When updating content, ALWAYS edit `src/data/resume.json` only. Changes automatically propagate throughout the site.

### Data Adapter Pattern

The project uses a **bidirectional adapter pattern**:

1. **JSON Resume → Internal:** `src/lib/resumeAdapter.ts`
   - Converts JSON Resume standard to internal ResumeData format
   - Strips `https://` from URLs
   - Parses location into address string
   - Converts highlights to keyAchievements

2. **Internal → JSON Resume:** `src/lib/jsonResume.ts`
   - Converts internal format back to JSON Resume
   - Validates with AJV schema
   - Adds `https://` back to URLs

3. **Internal → Portfolio UI:** `src/lib/data/portfolio.ts`
   - Transforms ResumeData to display types
   - Formats dates (ISO → "Mon YYYY")
   - Extracts contact info from social media

### Type System (4 Layers)

```typescript
// 1. External Standard (jsonresume.org)
types/json-resume.ts
  → JSONResume, JSONResumeBasics, JSONResumeWork

// 2. Internal Application Types
types/resume.ts
  → ResumeData, WorkExperience, Education, SkillGroup

// 3. Display/UI Types
types/portfolio.ts
  → Experience, Skill, Project, ContactInfo

// 4. Feature-Specific Types
types/cover-letter.ts, types/openai.ts
```

---

## Common Development Tasks

### 1. Update Portfolio Content

**User Request:** "Update my work experience"

**Action:**

```typescript
// Edit src/data/resume.json
{
  "work": [
    {
      "name": "New Company",
      "position": "New Role",
      "startDate": "2024-01-15",
      "endDate": "",  // Present
      "summary": "Role description",
      "highlights": [
        "Achievement with metrics",
        "Impact-driven result"
      ],
      "keywords": ["Tech1", "Tech2"]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Verify:**

```bash
npm run dev
# Check http://localhost:3000 (homepage)
# Check http://localhost:3000/resume/builder (editor)
```

### 2. Add New Homepage Section

**Steps:**

1. Add data to `resume.json`
2. Create component in `src/components/sections/`
3. Import in `src/app/page.tsx`
4. Update `src/lib/data/portfolio.ts` (if needed)
5. Add tests

### 3. Fix Build Errors

**Common Issue:** TypeScript errors after data changes

```bash
# Diagnose
npm run build

# Fix pattern:
# 1. Update types in src/types/
# 2. Update adapter in src/lib/resumeAdapter.ts
# 3. Update components to handle new fields
```

### 4. Modify Password Protection

**Enable:**

```bash
# Generate hash
node scripts/generate-password-hash.mjs "password"

# Add to .env.local
echo 'NEXT_PUBLIC_EDIT_PASSWORD_HASH="$2b$10$..."' >> .env.local

# Restart dev server
npm run dev
```

**Disable:**

```bash
# Remove from .env.local or set to empty
NEXT_PUBLIC_EDIT_PASSWORD_HASH=""
```

**Production:** Add to GitHub Secrets → `NEXT_PUBLIC_EDIT_PASSWORD_HASH`

### 5. Test Changes

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test
npm test -- path/to/test.test.tsx

# Watch mode during development
npm test:watch

# Coverage report
npm test:coverage
```

### 6. Maintain Related Documentation and Tests

**CRITICAL:** When making code changes, always update related artifacts:

**Documentation Updates:**

- Update `ARCHITECTURE.md` for architectural changes
- Update `docs/` feature guides for feature changes
- Update inline comments for complex logic
- Update JSDoc for public APIs

**Test Updates:**

- Add tests for new functionality
- Update tests for changed behavior
- Ensure tests pass before committing
- Maintain test coverage above 85%

**Type Updates:**

- Update TypeScript interfaces in `src/types/`
- Update adapter logic in `src/lib/resumeAdapter.ts`
- Ensure type safety across the codebase

**Example Workflow:**

```bash
# 0. ALWAYS start on feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# 1. Make code change
# 2. Update related tests
npm test -- path/to/changed-file.test.tsx

# 3. Update documentation
# Edit ARCHITECTURE.md or relevant docs/ file

# 4. Verify everything works
npm run build
npm test

# 5. Commit all related changes together
git add .
git commit -m "feat: feature with tests and docs"

# 6. Push to feature branch
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# 7. Create PR for review
gh pr create --title "feat: Your feature" --body "..."
```

## Code Quality & Formatting

### Automated Formatting (Git Hooks)

**Pre-commit hooks automatically enforce code quality:**

1. **ESLint** - Lints and auto-fixes JavaScript/TypeScript
2. **Prettier** - Formats all files with strict opinionated style
3. **Tailwind CSS** - Automatically sorts utility classes

**Configuration:**

- **Prettier:** `.prettierrc.json` (strict, single quotes, no semicolons)
- **Tailwind CSS:** `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss` (automatic class sorting)
- **Git Hooks:** Husky + lint-staged (runs on `git commit`)

**Manual Commands:**

```bash
# Format entire codebase
npm run format

# Check formatting without modifying files
npm run format:check

# Run linter
npm run lint
```

**What Gets Formatted:**

- JavaScript/TypeScript files: ESLint + Prettier
- JSON, Markdown, CSS, HTML, YAML: Prettier only
- Tailwind classes: Automatically sorted by importance

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Never bypass git hooks. All code must pass formatting before commit.

---

## Development Workflows

### Local Development

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Always keep the dev server running in the background on port 3000**

```bash
# Start dev server with automatic cleanup (RECOMMENDED)
npm run dev:reload

# Run tests in watch mode (in another terminal)
npm test:watch

# Check types (no emit)
npx tsc --noEmit

# Lint
npm run lint
```

**Dev Server Management Rules:**

1. **Always Running:** Use `npm run dev:reload` after each significant change to keep dev server running
2. **Default Port:** Port 3000. The `dev:reload` script automatically handles port conflicts
3. **When to Use `npm run dev:reload`:**
   - After completing a feature or fix
   - When new files are added
   - When files are removed
   - After fundamental changes (structure, configuration, dependencies)
   - When you encounter stale build issues

**What `npm run dev:reload` Does:**

```bash
# Automatically performs these steps:
# 1. Kill any process on port 3000
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null || true

# 2. Remove stale build cache
rm -rf .next

# 3. Start fresh dev server
npm run dev
```

**Manual Dev Server Control (if needed):**

```bash
# Start dev server normally (if no conflicts)
npm run dev

# Check what's using port 3000
lsof -ti:3000

# Manually kill port 3000
kill -9 $(lsof -ti:3000)
```

### Pre-Commit Checklist

**Note:** Git hooks automatically run lint-staged on commit, which handles:

- ✅ ESLint fixes (`eslint --fix`)
- ✅ Prettier formatting (includes Tailwind CSS class sorting)

**Manual checks before committing:**

- [ ] Tests passing (`npm test`)
- [ ] TypeScript compiles (`npm run build`)
- [ ] Changes tested in dev server
- [ ] Documentation updated (ARCHITECTURE.md, docs/, inline comments)
- [ ] Tests added/updated for new/changed functionality
- [ ] Type definitions updated (if data structures changed)

### Deployment Workflow (GitHub Flow)

**🚨 CRITICAL: Follow GitHub Flow. NEVER push directly to `main`.**

```bash
# 1. Create feature branch (if not already on one)
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# 2. Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: description"

# 3. Push to feature branch
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# 4. Create Pull Request
gh pr create --title "feat: Your feature" --body "Description..."
# OR create PR manually via GitHub web interface

# 5. Wait for CI checks to pass
#    GitHub Actions automatically runs:
#    - npm test (PR fails if any test fails)
#    - npm run build (PR fails if build fails)

# 6. After user approves and merges PR:
#    GitHub Actions automatically:
#    - Runs npm test (fails deployment if any test fails)
#    - Runs npm run build (includes sitemap generation)
#    - Deploys to GitHub Pages

# 7. Site live in 2-3 minutes after merge
```

**⚠️ Important:**

- Deployment FAILS if ANY test fails (enforced by CI)
- PRs MUST pass CI checks before merging
- NEVER merge your own PRs - wait for user approval
- Main branch is protected - direct pushes should be blocked

---

## Code Patterns & Conventions

### File Naming

- **Components:** PascalCase (`PersonalInformation.tsx`)
- **Utilities:** camelCase (`resumeAdapter.ts`)
- **Types:** kebab-case (`json-resume.ts`)
- **Tests:** Same as file with `.test.tsx` suffix

### Component Structure

```typescript
// 1. Imports
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import type { ResumeData } from '@/types'

// 2. Types (if needed)
interface Props {
  data: ResumeData
}

// 3. Component
export default function MyComponent({ data }: Props) {
  // 4. Hooks
  const [state, setState] = useState()

  // 5. Handlers
  const handleClick = () => { ... }

  // 6. Render
  return <div>...</div>
}
```

### Data Transformation

**Always use adapter functions:**

```typescript
// ✅ Good
import resumeData from '@/lib/resumeAdapter'
const experience = resumeData.workExperience

// ❌ Bad
import jsonResume from '@/data/resume.json'
const experience = jsonResume.work // Wrong format!
```

### State Management

- **Resume/Cover Letter Editors:** Use `ResumeContext` / `DocumentContext`
- **Homepage:** Static data from `portfolio.ts` (no client state)

---

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Editing Wrong Files

❌ **DON'T** edit display components for content changes
✅ **DO** edit `src/data/resume.json`

### 2. Missing Type Updates

❌ **DON'T** add fields to JSON without updating types
✅ **DO** update: types → adapter → UI (in that order)

### 3. Breaking Password Protection

❌ **DON'T** modify `src/config/password.ts` logic
✅ **DO** only set environment variable

### 4. Skipping Tests

❌ **DON'T** skip failing tests
✅ **DO** fix tests before deployment (GitHub Actions enforces this)

### 5. Direct State Mutation

```typescript
// ❌ Bad
resumeData.name = 'New Name'

// ✅ Good
setResumeData({ ...resumeData, name: 'New Name' })
```

## Tool Usage & Intelligence Maximization

> **🚨 CRITICAL:** Always prioritize MCP Server tools (see "MCP Server Tool Priority" section above). Use built-in tools only as fallback.

### Tool Priority Hierarchy

**Tier 1 - ALWAYS USE FIRST (MCP Server Tools):**

**File Operations:**

- **mcp**desktop-commander**read_file** - PREFERRED for reading files
- **mcp**desktop-commander**write_file** - PREFERRED for writing files (auto-chunks)
- **mcp**desktop-commander**edit_block** - PREFERRED for editing files (exact matching)
- **mcp**desktop-commander**list_directory** - PREFERRED for directory listing

**Search Operations:**

- **mcp**desktop-commander**start_search** - PREFERRED for file/content search (streaming)
- **mcp**desktop-commander**get_more_search_results** - Paginate through search results
- **mcp**desktop-commander**stop_search** - Cancel search early

**Process Management:**

- **mcp**desktop-commander**start_process** - MANDATORY for local file analysis
- **mcp**desktop-commander**interact_with_process** - MANDATORY for REPL interactions
- **mcp**desktop-commander**read_process_output** - Monitor process output
- **mcp**desktop-commander**list_sessions** - View active processes

**Tier 2 - FALLBACK (Built-in Tools):**

Use these ONLY when MCP tools are unavailable:

- **Read** - Fallback for file reading
- **Edit** - Fallback for file editing
- **Write** - Fallback for file writing
- **Glob** - Fallback for file pattern matching
- **Grep** - Fallback for content search

**Tier 3 - ALWAYS AVAILABLE:**

- **Bash** - For git, npm, docker, system commands ONLY
- **Task tool with Explore agent** - For "How does X work?" questions
- **TodoWrite** - ALWAYS use for multi-step tasks (3+ steps)
- **AskUserQuestion** - Clarify requirements, get decisions

### Best Practices

1. **MCP First** - Check for MCP tools before using built-in tools
2. **Parallel Operations** - Call multiple independent tools in one message
3. **Plan Before Execute** - TodoWrite for multi-step tasks
4. **Search Strategy** -
   - Desktop Commander `start_search` for streaming results
   - Fallback to Glob for files, Grep for content if MCP unavailable
5. **Dev Server Always Running** - Use `npm run dev:reload` after each change
   - Automatically kills port conflicts, clears `.next/` cache, and restarts server
   - Run in background to keep development environment ready
   - Essential for immediate feedback on code changes
6. **Maintain Related Artifacts** - When making code changes, intelligently update:
   - Documentation (README.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, feature docs in `docs/`)
   - Tests (unit, integration, e2e)
   - Type definitions
   - Comments and JSDoc
7. **Expert Mindset** - Think like a senior engineer (see "Expert Decision Making" above)

## Quick Reference

### Key Files

| Task                     | File                                         |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Update content**       | `src/data/resume.json`                       |
| **Add homepage section** | `src/components/sections/`                   |
| **Modify editor**        | `src/components/resume/forms/`               |
| **Change types**         | `src/types/`                                 |
| **Update metadata**      | `src/config/metadata.ts`                     |
| **Modify auth**          | `src/components/auth/PasswordProtection.tsx` |
| **AI prompts**           | `src/lib/ai/document-prompts.ts`             |

### Essential Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # Dev server
npm test             # Run tests
npm run build        # Production build
npm run lint         # Run ESLint
npm run format       # Format with Prettier + Tailwind
npm run format:check # Check formatting

node scripts/generate-password-hash.mjs "password"  # Generate hash
npx tsc --noEmit     # Type check
```

### Environment Variables

```bash
# .env.local (local development)
NEXT_PUBLIC_EDIT_PASSWORD_HASH="$2b$10$..."

# GitHub Secrets (production)
NEXT_PUBLIC_EDIT_PASSWORD_HASH
```

### Common Queries

**"Where is the homepage?"** → `src/app/page.tsx`
**"Where is the resume editor?"** → `src/app/resume/builder/page.tsx`
**"Where is the data?"** → `src/data/resume.json`
**"Where are tests?"** → `src/**/__tests__/`
**"How to add password?"** → Generate hash, set `NEXT_PUBLIC_EDIT_PASSWORD_HASH`
**"How to customize colors?"** → `src/app/globals.css`
**"How to deploy?"** → Create PR from feature branch, merge to main (GitHub Actions auto-deploys)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Build Failures

```bash
# Check TypeScript
npm run build

# Check tests
npm test

# Validate resume.json
node -e "JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('src/data/resume.json'))"

# Clean install
rm -rf node_modules .next out
npm install
```

### Password Not Working

- Check `NEXT_PUBLIC_EDIT_PASSWORD_HASH` is set
- Regenerate hash: `node scripts/generate-password-hash.mjs "password"`
- Clear browser cache / use incognito
- Check GitHub Secrets (production)

### Tests Failing

```bash
# Verbose output
npm test -- --verbose

# Specific test
npm test -- path/to/test.test.tsx

# Clear Jest cache
npm test -- --clearCache
```

### GitHub Pages 404

- Ensure `.nojekyll` file exists in `out/`
- Check GitHub Pages settings (Actions enabled)
- Verify deployment succeeded (Actions tab)
- Wait 2-3 minutes for CDN cache

---

## Security

## Code Quality & Automation

**ESLint Gradual Improvement Plan:** [docs/ESLINT_GRADUAL_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md](./docs/ESLINT_GRADUAL_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md)

### Current Status

> **Note:** For current violation counts, run `npm run lint`. See [ESLINT_GRADUAL_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md](./docs/ESLINT_GRADUAL_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md) for detailed tracking.

**Enforced (Error - Blocks Commits):**

- ✅ `@typescript-eslint/no-require-imports` - Fully enforced
- ✅ `react/no-unescaped-entities` - Fully enforced
- ✅ `no-relative-import-paths/no-relative-import-paths` - Enforces @/ alias imports
- ✅ `check-file/filename-naming-convention` - Enforces PascalCase components, camelCase libs, kebab-case types
- ✅ `check-file/folder-naming-convention` - Enforces kebab-case folder names
- ✅ **Commit Message Linting** - Conventional commits enforced via commitlint
- ✅ **Test Coverage Thresholds** - 85% minimum coverage (branches, functions, lines, statements)

**Code Quality (Warning - Gradual Improvement):**

- ⚠️ `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-expressions` - Being actively fixed
- ⚠️ `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` - Gradual replacement in progress
- ⚠️ `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` - Gradual cleanup in progress
- ⚠️ **JSDoc Documentation** - Public APIs should have JSDoc comments
- ⚠️ **Security Rules** - 11 security patterns monitored

### Improvement Approach

The project follows a gradual improvement strategy for code quality warnings:

1. **Critical rules enforced immediately** (errors block commits)
2. **Quality rules as warnings** (allow gradual improvement)
3. **Systematic cleanup** (fix violations incrementally)
4. **Promote to errors** (once violations reach zero)

**See full plan:** [docs/ESLINT_GRADUAL_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md](./docs/ESLINT_GRADUAL_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md)

### Automated Enforcement Tools

**The following conventions are now enforced automatically (no Claude Code needed):**

#### 1. Commit Message Format (commitlint)

- **Tool:** `@commitlint/config-conventional`
- **Enforced:** Conventional commit format (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)
- **Trigger:** Git commit hook
- **Config:** `commitlint.config.js`

#### 2. File Naming Conventions (eslint-plugin-check-file)

- **Components:** PascalCase (`PersonalInformation.tsx`)
- **Utilities:** camelCase (`resumeAdapter.ts`)
- **Types:** kebab-case (`json-resume.ts`)
- **Folders:** kebab-case everywhere
- **Config:** `eslint.config.mjs`

#### 3. Import Path Enforcement (eslint-plugin-no-relative-import-paths)

- **Rule:** All imports must use `@/` alias (no `../` or `./` except same folder)
- **Enforced:** Error level (blocks commits)
- **Config:** `eslint.config.mjs`

#### 4. Test Coverage Thresholds (Jest)

- **Minimum:** 85% coverage (branches, functions, lines, statements)
- **Enforced:** `npm test:coverage` fails if below threshold
- **Config:** `jest.config.js`

#### 5. TypeScript Strict Mode

- **Additional checks:**
  - `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` - Safer array/object access
  - `noImplicitOverride` - Explicit override keyword
  - `noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature` - Safer property access
  - `noUncheckedSideEffectImports` - Import side effects must be explicit
- **Config:** `tsconfig.json`

#### 6. JSDoc Documentation (eslint-plugin-jsdoc)

- **Enforced:** Public functions, classes, interfaces, type aliases
- **Level:** Warning (gradual adoption)
- **Config:** `eslint.config.mjs`

#### 7. Security Patterns (eslint-plugin-security)

- **Monitored:** 11 security patterns (unsafe regex, eval, timing attacks, etc.)
- **Critical errors:** Unsafe regex, eval, pseudo-random bytes
- **Warnings:** Object injection, non-literal require, child process
- **Config:** `eslint.config.mjs`
